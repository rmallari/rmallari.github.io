<h1> Information about XQUERY </h1>
	<ul>
		<li>
			XQuery is a database language. Databases store very many / very large documents: indexes and query optimization are important (the data does not fit completely into main memory). XQuery is designed to meet the requirements identified by the W3C XML Query Working Group XQuery 3.1 Requirements. It is designed to be a language in which queries are concise and easily understood. It is also flexible enough to query a broad spectrum of XML information sources, including both databases and documents. The Query Working Group has identified a requirement for both a non-XML query syntax and an XML-based query syntax. XQuery is designed to meet the first of these requirements. XQuery is derived from an XML query language called Quilt, which in turn borrowed features from several other languages, including XPath 1.0, XQL , XML-QL, SQL, and OQL (ODMG). XQuery language itself - or its cousin XSLT2 - is powerful enough to write any transformation of an XML tree. The XQuery Update Facility is a powerful, convenient and elegant extension of the XQuery language, in spite of a few peculiarities that can be slightly off-putting for programmers.[1,2] XQuery is a W3C standard, just like HTML and XML, and is perfectly tailored for working with HTML, XML and REST. This means more elegant programs and less code. [5] here are some features, advantages and disadvantages of using XQUERY. 
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
			There are many features of XQuery query language. A list of top features are given below:
		</li>
		<br>
		<ul>
				<li>
					XQuery is a functional language. It is used to retrieve and query XML based data.
				</li>
				<li>
					XQuery is expression-oriented programming language with a simple type system.
				</li>
				<li>
					XQuery is analogous to SQL. For example: As SQL is query language for databases, same as XQuery is query language for XML.
				</li>
				<li>
					XQuery is XPath based and uses XPath expressions to navigate through XML documents.
				</li>
				<li>
					XQuery is a W3C standard and universally supported by all major databases.
				</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<li>
			A list of the Advantages are given below:
		</li>
		<br>
		<ul>
				<li>
					XQuery can be used to retrieve both hierarchal and tabular data.
				</li>
				<li>
					XQuery can also be used to query tree and graphical structures.
				</li>
				<li>
					XQUery can used to build web pages
				</li>
				<li>
					XQuery can be used to query web pages.
				</li>
				<li>
					XQuery is best for XML-based databases and object-based databases. Object databases are much more flexible and powerful than purely tabular databases.
				</li>
				<li>
					XQuery can be used to transform XML documents into XHTML documents.
				</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<li>
			A list of the Disadvantages are given below:
		</li>
		<br>
		<ul>
				<li>
					XQuery Does Not Automatically Support Hierarchical Processing
				</li>
				<li>
					XQuery and SQL/XML Processors Try to Solve Both Sides of XML Processing
				</li>
				<li>
					XQuery Does Not Support SQL's Powerful SELECT Operator
				</li>
				<li>
					XQuery is Not a Query Language and is Not Declarative
				</li>

			The purpose of the code of hw8.sq is for the hw8.xml file is to return the resulting element for each book that have price less than 30 to the book element of the root element bookstore.

			XQIB allows you to program client-side Web applications with XQuery instead of, or as a complement to JavaScript. It works in most modern browsers (IE9, Firefox 3.6+, Chrome 8+, Safari 5) and does not require the installation of any plugin. XQIB provides an implementation of the EXPath http-client module so that you can make REST calls (GET, POSTâ€¦) with http-client:send-request (side-effecting). The http-client namespace is not bound to any prefix by default, so you will need to import this module explicitly. using an XQuery Web application server (such as MarkLogic or Sausalito) in conjunction with XQIB, having the same language on both the server and the client side allows you to reuse your code.
